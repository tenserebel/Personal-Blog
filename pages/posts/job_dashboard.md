# Job Tracking Dashboard

## View the Dashboard

You can view the interactive dashboard here: [Job Search Tracking Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/2d286904-b2af-490a-8937-fa8aa26168ef)

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to track my job applications through a dashboard, allowing me to better understand how my job search is progressing. This dashboard helps monitor key data such as:

- Number of applications submitted
- Current status of applications
- Companies applied to

My goal was to dive into the data to evaluate the responses I've been receiving and identify areas for improvement.

I used **Google Looker Studio** with its built-in connector for **Google Sheets**. Since all data was manually tracked in Google Sheets, minimal cleaning was required.
